I need to index easily in the future a few manually input variables and then be able to schedule the scraping every hour with whatever manual input.
Things to index and input this can also be called metadata:
- Name of the Facebook page
- Niche (a string separated by commas)
- Products being sold (a string separated by commas)


Niches:

Courses
